# CI/CD Pipeline on a Simple Calculator Program
In this project, I aim to automate the development, testing and deployment of a simple calculator program
by creating a CI/CD pipeline on it. The calculator program developed here is a Spring Boot project
hosted on an embedded tomcat web server running in a Docker container. The calculator currently supports
the four basic mathematical operations and can be accessed as a service. The service can be called
via GET request either through curl or through a web browser.
The CI/CD pipeline is built using the following tools:
1. Development: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Github
2. Testing: JUnit
3. Integration: Apache Maven, Jenkins
4. Delivery: Docker, Docker hub, Jenkins
5. Deployment: Docker, Rundeck, Jenkins
6. Monitoring: Elastic Stack
